A very light weight plugin, minifies, caches and combine JavaScript and CSS files into a single file on demand to speed up page loads.

== Description ==
This plugin minifies, caches and combine JavaScript and CSS files into a single file on demand to speed up page loads, using [Minify PHP Framework](https://code.google.com/p/minify/) and [minit](https://github.com/kasparsd/minit).

By activating this plugin, you will see the source of your HTML, inline JavaScript and CSS are now compressed and your external Javascript and CSS files are combined into a single file. The size will be smaller and quite helpful to improve your page load speed as well as google page speed and yslow grade (if you care).

To check whether this plugin works properly, simply view your site source or press Ctrl + U from your keyboard. In the end of the source, you should see message something like:

*** Total size saved: 11.341% | Size before compression: 27104 bytes | Size after compression: 24030 bytes. ***

**P.S. It is aways the best policy to open a [support thread](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/wp-super-minify) first before posting a negative review.**

== Installation ==
1. Upload the `wp-super-minify` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory

3. That's it!
